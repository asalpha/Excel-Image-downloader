Now its improved because theres only one battery instead of two, and it lasts much longer. Plus, the light is now green instead of red, making it more visible to anglers that often chase catfish at night. Zebco has also worked hard to improve the performance and ease of use of the strike sensitivity adjustment. This 60sz combo features a 7' medium-heavy action rod with a high-vis green tip.
